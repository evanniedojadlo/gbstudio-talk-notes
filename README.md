# How I Used LLMs to Design a GameBoy Game to Propose to My Girlfriend

This is a talk that I put together for The Dog Days of DevOps event for the meetup group [Cloud Austin](https://www.meetup.com/CloudAustin/events/wxgbbtygclbbc/). This was a brief overview of how using an LLM led me to GBStudio to design and create art for a game that I used to propose to my girlfriend.

I took the GBStudio example game and broke it down to the platformer portion. I added some high-level text, which I used to describe each section of my talk.

I'm sharing the template here for anyone who wants to do something similar, whether that's a proposal, conference talk, etc. Feel free to reach out to me and I can walk you through any of this.

### Steps to edit the game template:

* In GBStudio, select "open project"
* Navigate to the appropriate directory and select `cloud-austin-lightning-talk.gbsproj`
* The project should load, and you will be able to navigate around the GBStudio UI to make edits
